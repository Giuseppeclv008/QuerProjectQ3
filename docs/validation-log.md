# Validation Log

## 2026-07-06 — Plan 2: DuckDB store, idempotent reprocessing (real data)

- File: telemetry_MCC777eda3db57348ef8a3113a642ae74db_2026-02-01.csv (86,399 rows, 109 cols)
- `clean` → DuckDB run 1: wrote 765,711 events; store rows 765,711
- `clean` → DuckDB run 2 (same file): wrote 765,711 events; store rows **765,711** (unchanged — upsert)
- Python oracle events: 765,711 (match)
- Spec cross-refs: §6 schema + UNIQUE key, §10 idempotency backbone, ~765k/day Appendix A
- ts-format scan, all 28 day-files (streamed from zip, no extraction): 0 malformed timestamps of 2,391,250 rows — strict-CAST interim policy is safe on current data

## 2026-07-08 — Plan 3: ZeroMQ MAS, 2 workers × 2 day-files (real data)

- Files: 2026-02-01 (86,399 rows) and 2026-02-02 (86,399 rows) day-files.
- Oracle expectations: day 01 = 765,711; day 02 = 998,920; total = 1,764,631.
- `mas_coordinator` (2 workers, tcp://127.0.0.1:5557/5558): "dispatched 2 files: 2 ok, 0 failed, 1764631 events" (wall clock 6.952s).
- Per-worker stores merged via `mas_merge`: merged store holds 1,764,631 rows; second merge run unchanged (idempotent, spec §10).
- Counter continuity verified: day 01 ends at Count 118929, day 02 starts at 118929 -> UNIQUE(machine_id, head_id, cap_seq) is collision-free across days (spec §14 Q3: cumulative counter; day-boundary seeding loses no caps between these days).
- Spec cross-refs: §5.2 PUSH/PULL fabric, §8 ventilator/worker/sink + day-file work unit, §14 Q4 per-worker stores merged at sink.

## 2026-07-09 — Plan 4: chaos E2E, worker killed mid-run + coordinator death (real data)

- Files: day-files 2026-02-01, 2026-02-02, 2026-02-03 (first three by date). Oracle (per-file `clean` into a fresh DuckDB store, counts from its stderr "wrote N cap events" line): day 01 = 765,711; day 02 = 998,920; day 03 = 525,602; **total = 2,290,233**.

### Direction 1 — worker SIGKILLed mid-run (spec §11 criterion 1): PASS

- Command: `scripts/chaos_e2e.sh "$D"/telemetry_..._2026-02-01.csv "$D"/telemetry_..._2026-02-02.csv "$D"/telemetry_..._2026-02-03.csv` with `D=telemetry_MCC777eda3db57348ef8a3113a642ae74db_2026-02` (2 workers on tcp://127.0.0.1:5571-5573, w1 killed with `kill -9` at t+2 s).
- Coordinator log (excerpt): `worker w1 joined` / `worker w2 joined` / `worker w1 dead (silent > 30000 ms)` / `re-dispatch ..._2026-02-03.csv (attempt 2)` / `re-dispatch ..._2026-02-02.csv (attempt 2)` / `re-dispatch ..._2026-02-01.csv (attempt 2)` / summary `dispatched 3 files: 3 ok, 0 failed, 2290233 events, 1 workers died`, exit 0.
- All three items were re-dispatched: ZMQ PUSH had round-robined every initial send onto the first-connected worker before the other's connect landed, so the killed worker held all three — the survivor absorbed the full set (`worker w2 done: 3 work items, store holds 2290233 rows`).
- Merge of both stores, dead worker's included: `merged 2 stores (0 skipped); dst holds 2290233 rows` — w1's store opened fine (killed ~2 s in; no rows or a committed-batch subset of w2's re-processed rows) and the idempotent upsert left the count unaffected.
- `PASS: merged 2290233 == oracle 2290233 (one worker killed mid-run)`. Wall clock 56 s first run, 57 s post-fix re-run (30 s death threshold dominates; identical outcome both runs).

### Direction 2 — coordinator death, orphan worker (spec §11 criterion 2): FAILED pre-fix at 121 s, PASSES post-fix at 61 s

- Command: `"$BUILD"/mas_worker tcp://127.0.0.1:5581 tcp://127.0.0.1:5582 tcp://127.0.0.1:5583 /tmp/w_orphan.duckdb w1 &` with nothing ever bound (per-second `kill -0` poll; pass = gone within 65 s).
- **Pre-fix FAIL (defect found by this E2E):** `run()` idle-exited on time — stderr `worker w1 done: 0 work items, store holds 0 rows` at t+61 s — but the *process* lived to t+121 s. Stack sample at t+75 s: main thread in `zmq_ctx_term -> zmq::ctx_t::terminate -> mailbox recv wait`, I/O thread still in `tcp_connecter_t::start_connecting`. Cause: `ZmqPushSink` coupled ZMQ_LINGER to `send_timeout_ms` (60000), and a connect-mode PUSH queues sends below HWM even with no peer ever present (SNDTIMEO cannot fire), so teardown waited out the full 60 s linger on ~61 undeliverable heartbeats. Invisible to the fake-transport unit suite (62/62 green throughout) — only this real-socket run could catch it.
- **Fix:** `ZmqPushSink` gained an explicit `linger_ms` parameter (default sentinel keeps the old coupling for all existing callers; coordinator unchanged); `mas_worker` passes `linger_ms=0` on its results + heartbeat sinks (protocol-safe: the coordinator STOPs only after every item is settled, and heartbeats are fire-and-forget). Regression-guarded by `ZmqTransport.ZeroLingerTeardownDropsUndeliverableQueueImmediately` (teardown with a queued undeliverable message must complete < 2 s; pre-fix behavior would hold it 60 s).
- **Post-fix:** `worker exited at t+61s` / `PASS: worker self-exited` / exit code 0 / stderr `worker w1 done: 0 work items, store holds 0 rows` — the 60-tick idle exit (60 × 1 s + hello) is now the process's actual lifetime, within the ~65 s budget.
- Full suite after fix: 63/63 PASS.
- Spec cross-refs: §6 death threshold 30 s + re-dispatch, §7 worker liveness (idle exit, send timeouts), §8 worker exit budget, §10 chaos test, §11 both success criteria.
